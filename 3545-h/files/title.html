<h3>PREFATORY NOTE</h3>
</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This volume is a reprint, extended and revised,
of the <i>Selected Poems</i> of Goldsmith issued by the Clarendon
Press in 1887. It is 'extended,' because it now contains the whole
of Goldsmith's poetry: it is 'revised' because, besides the
supplementary text, a good deal has been added in the way of
annotation and illustration. In other words, the book has been
substantially enlarged. Of the new editorial material, the bulk has
been collected at odd times during the last twenty years; but fresh
Goldsmith facts are growing rare. I hope I have acknowledged
obligation wherever it has been incurred; I trust also, for the
sake of those who come after me, that something of my own will be
found to have been contributed to the literature of the
subject.</p>
